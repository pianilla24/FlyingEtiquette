# FlyingEtiquette
Data about Flying Etiquette for J124

Is it rude to wake a passenger up if you are trying to go to the bathroom?


## Why I choose this question? 
>I have always been a person who overthinks situations. While on a trip to Washington D.C. from San Francisco I ran into this dilemma. I wondered if the person next to me would be bothered if I woke them up due to my limited bladder.

## What I found interesting about this dataset? 
> It is really interesting to see how many questions included the word rude, 9 questions total. I wonder if a survey of flying ettiquette could also include opinions like someone helping you lift up your luggage when placing in the overhead bin or switching seasts with someone that seems to be a nervous flyer. Would these sort of ideas, if included in this survey, influence better flying ettiquette practices. 

## What does this chart reveal? 
This chart reveals majority of the people, 535, do not find it rude to wake up a passenger when trying to use the restroom. 

There there was a small groups of people, 34, who find it extemely rude. A follow up question would be to ask these individuals why they find it <ins> very </ins> rude. Is it due to them not wanting to be disturbed? Or because they are very responsbile flyers who always make sure to use the restroom before the flight as to not disturb their fellow flyers.
